## Finding and asking for help

Use the `man` command to look up information about commands (e.g., learn about the `ls` command with `man ls`. In the help viewer, press `h` to find out how to navigate the interface, and press `q` to quit.) Manpages are installed on most Linux distributions, and are also available online at [man.he.net](http://man.he.net) and many other places.

Explore forums like the [Unix and Linux Community on StackExchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com), the [ServerFault](https://serverfault.com) community, and others.

View information about which Linux distribution you're using with `cat /etc/*release`. 

Find out the release of the kernel you're using with `uname -r`. 

Use `uname -a` to display some more information about the platform and architecture that you're using.
